# Palindromo
Web page that analyzes if  a word is a palindrome

The program doesn't run because:
At first my Model had 2 fields ( descrip as a charfield and also the pk, and created_date that saves the time when the user puts a word)
The exercise tells you that when the user create a word that is already in the database, change the time and update it. Because of this i was forced to change my model and add a new field which was Id (as pk). I edited all the code and run it but the database won't work as i expected. 
Trying to solve the data base problem i just bugged the program i think but there's the code.
The model has 2 field because i change it to see if reverting the changes it works , so if you see things that doesnt make sense or values that doesn't match if because of that.
